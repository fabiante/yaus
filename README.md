# Yet Another URL Shortener

Nothing more than a coding exercise and playground to play around with
ideas related to URL shortening and HTTP redirects.

Maybe some experiments with [PURLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_uniform_resource_locator).

## Tests

This project also contains some experiments with BDD. The `bdd` directory contains
specifications and drivers to test the application.
